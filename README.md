## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am junior dev looking forward to learning more about development!

Initially followed a web dev training course focusing on PHP and JS, after which i deployed a first personnal web project by creating a fansite (https://main.shigumanofans.com).

While so far i have mostly experienced PHP (Laravel & Symfony) and JS/TS (Vue, React, Angular), I am currently self-learning Java and Spring to increase my knowledge and see other project environments.

â›”Only projects intended as study or software will be public repository. All repositories about personal projects intended to be deployed as web apps are strictly private.
